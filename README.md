## Credits
I have struggled to understand how to come up with the answers and have had some help from my wonderful partner Aldo Tanca who knows arrays although he codes in Python. I had a look online at Stack OVerflow and Google as well to see what others have done. Had a look at chat gpt but that was a bad idea as it gave me something with a value like Infinity and -Infinity to come up with the greatest increase. The journey continues!
